# Text Mining: High Dimensional Clustering

  Clustering is an unsupervised technique for grouping a set of objects in such way that objects
  in the same group are more similar in some sense or another to each other than to those in other
  groups. There are several decisions to be taken before tackling the problem such as the number of
  groups to use, the measures to use in order to decide which element belongs to which group... These
  questions will be addressed showing the advantages and disadvantages of each configuration.
